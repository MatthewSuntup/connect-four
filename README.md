# Connect Four Bot
This code was developed for a University of Sydney assignment in the Advanced Introduction to Artificial Intelligence course (2020 Semester 1). It is now being updated with clearer organisation and documentation for an unfamiliar reader.

Two versions of an automated Connect Four player were produced, based on two sets of requirements for the assignment. One version followed stricter requirements and provided the user with more options, while the second was streamlined to compete in a tournament against other bots.
